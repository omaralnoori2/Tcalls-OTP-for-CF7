== Description ==

## Tcalls is a WordPress plugin that integrates with the popular Contact Form 7 plugin to enhance form security by adding OTP (One-Time Password) validation via WhatsApp.

When users submit a form on a website using Contact Form 7, this plugin sends an OTP to the userâ€™s WhatsApp number. The form submission is only completed after the user enters the correct OTP, ensuring that the submission is verified and reducing spam or fraudulent submissions.
